# Zerodha Clone Project

This project is a clone of the Zerodha trading platform, built using modern web technologies. It consists of three main directories: `backend`, `dashboard`, and `frontend`. The goal is to replicate the core features of the Zerodha platform with functionalities such as trading, user dashboard, and market data retrieval.

## Project Structure

### Backend

The **backend** is built using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**. It handles the server-side logic, such as user authentication, trading operations, and database interactions.


### Dashboard

The **dashboard** is a **React** application that provides the user interface (UI) for the trading platform. It allows users to view market data, manage their portfolio, and execute trades.

### Frontend

The **frontend** is built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It communicates with the backend to display real-time market data and execute trades. The frontend provides a simple and user-friendly interface to interact with the trading system. 

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Secure login and registration system using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- **Trade Execution:** Users can place buy and sell orders.
- **Market Data:** Real-time stock prices and trading volume.
- **Portfolio Management:** View the current portfolio, balance, and trading history.
- **Dashboard:** A responsive dashboard built with React.
